# Lightrift Game Studio

Lightrift Game Studio brings together user interactivity and high-performance
vector graphic animation to rapidly create quality games. It is the front-end to
[Anari Graphics System][4] and the [Ratscript][5] language.

Our vision is to make high-performance RAD tools available to animators and game
developers of all experience levels. See the [official project page][1].
