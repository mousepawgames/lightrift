Lightrift Game Studio
=====================

Lightrift Game Studio brings together user interactivity and high-performance vector graphic animation to rapidly create quality games. It uses the open-source [Anari Graphics System][4] and the [Ratscript][5] language.

Our vision is to make high-performance RAD tools available to animators and game developers of all experience levels. See the [official project page][1].
